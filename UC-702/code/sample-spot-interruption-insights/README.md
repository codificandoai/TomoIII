# Spot Interruption Insights - Serverless Event-Driven Spot Interruption Monitoring and Analytics Dashboard

## Introduction 
Spot Interruption Insights for Auto Scaling Groups is a serverless, event-driven monitoring and analytics dashboard designed to provide near real-time visibility into EC2 Spot Instance interruptions specifically for instances managed by Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs). While Spot Instances offer significant cost savings, their unpredictable interruptions can lead to operational challenges for ASG-managed workloads. This solution captures Spot Interruption warnings via Amazon EventBridge, routes them through SQS, and processes them with AWS Lambda, storing rich event data in OpenSearch for visualization. The dashboard exclusively tracks and analyzes interruption patterns for ASG-launched Spot Instances, helping teams optimize ASG configurations, improve capacity planning for auto-scaled workloads, design effective fallback mechanisms, and make informed decisions about instance type diversification within their Auto Scaling Groups.


## Architecture

![Diagram](/images/spot-interruption-insights.drawio.png)

## Solution Overview
The architecture leverages a serverless, event-driven approach utilizing AWS native services for robust interruption monitoring. EC2 Spot interruption notices are captured via an Amazon EventBridge rule and routed to an SQS queue for reliable message handling. A Lambda function processes the events, fetching EC2 instance metadata and Auto Scaling Group (ASG) details by making optimized batch calls to the EC2 and Auto Scaling APIs. This design minimizes throttling risks on the control plane APIs, ensuring scalability. The Lambda function is appropriately configured with batching and concurrency limits to prevent overwhelming the API endpoints and the OpenSearch bulk indexing process. After processing, events are bulk-indexed into Amazon OpenSearch Service, enabling near real-time visibility and analytics. A Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) ensures no data is lost in case of failures, while IAM roles enforce least-privilege access between all components.

OpenSearch is deployed within the private subnets of a VPC, ensuring it is not publicly accessible. Access to OpenSearch Dashboards is routed through an Application Load Balancer (ALB) configured with an HTTPS listener, which forwards traffic to an NGINX proxy running on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. This setup provides secure and scalable access. Authentication and authorization are enforced using OpenSearch’s internal user database, ensuring that only authorized users can access the dashboards. 

OpenSearch Dashboards visualize interruption metrics, delivering actionable insights to support effective capacity planning and workload placement.

### Extensibility and Alternative Analytics Tools
While this solution uses Amazon OpenSearch Service for storing and visualizing Spot Interruption data, the architecture is flexible and can be extended to support other analytics and observability platforms. You can modify the Lambda function to forward data to tools such as Amazon QuickSight, Amazon Timestream, Amazon Redshift, or external services like Datadog, Splunk, or Elastic Cloud, depending on your analytics and compliance needs. This enables teams to use their preferred tooling for building visualizations, setting alerts, or integrating with existing dashboards.

### Configure and deploy sample visualisations and dashboard

Sample visualizations and a starter dashboard are provided under the data folder in the file named **spot-interruption-dashboard-visualisations.ndjson**.
To import them:

- Navigate to Saved Objects under Dashboard Management in OpenSearch Dashboards.

- Import the spot-interruption-dashboard-visualisations.ndjson file.

- During the import, you may encounter index pattern conflicts. Select the index pattern you created from the dropdown and click **"Confirm all changes"**.

![Diagram](/images/domain-dashboard-importupdatedmessage.png)

Once imported, the sample visualizations and dashboard linked to your index pattern will be available.
You can view the Spot Interruption Dashboard, which includes visualizations based on Availability Zones, Regions, Instance Types, Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs), and Interruptions over time.
You can further customize by creating your own visualizations using the attributes available in the index or by editing/creating new dashboards.

## Testing

A temporary event rule is created during deployment to simulate matching EC2 Spot interruption notices. The rule name will be the name you specified during deployment for parameter **"CustomEventRuleName"**

To verify the solution, you can send sample events as shown in the image below. Replace the instance-id with the actual instance id that is associated with an ASG

![Diagram](/images/eb-test-event.png)

- Once the event is sent successfully, you can log in to the OpenSearch Dashboard and view the **Spot Interruption Dashboard**, where instance-related visualizations should appear. Alternatively, you can navigate to the **"Discover"** section via the hamburger menu to view the raw event details. Ensure the correct index pattern is selected, and adjust the time range if necessary (e.g., to the last 15 minutes) to view the latest data. 


## Sample visualisations and Dashboard

Once the OpenSearch Dashboard is set up and the sample visualizations are imported, you can explore the **"Spot Interruption Dashboard"**, which has been pre-built using the indexed event data. This dashboard provides insights across key dimensions such as Availability Zones, Regions, Instance Types, Auto Scaling Groups, and interruption trends over time. Use it as a starting point to understand the kind of insights possible, and feel free to customize or create new visualizations based on the fields available in the index.
